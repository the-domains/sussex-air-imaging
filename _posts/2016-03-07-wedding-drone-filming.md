**Have that unique touch at your Sussex wedding by hiring our licensed and insured drone to take pictures and film of your guests and venue.**

More and more couples are looking for their wedding to be slightly different than the norm -- so why not capture your special day from the air with our licensed and insured drone for stunning wedding aerial drone photography in Sussex?

We have the perfect solution to make sure all your wedding guests are in one photo, and for the adventurous, why not make a heart, or spell the couples name with people?

Using both still images and film, we can provide you with extra content for the wedding album or film, by supplying your chosen photographer with exactly what they need. We work with them to fit in with your schedule and style of images/film.

Our clients have used images on thank you cards, or as the opening images to the wedding photo album. Not only is it fun to capture your venue and guests from the air, but it's also a memory which will last forever. You've spent your hard earned cash on a stunning venue, so let our wedding drone capture it from the air.

We can fly up to 400ft to make sure we get the whole venue in the shot.

We have worked with a number of film production companies to incorporate our drone footage into the main wedding film -- this adds a massive amount of production value to the production.

From only Â£395.00, our aerial team will conduct a number of drone flights and delivery the results to yourselves or a production company if preferred.

**PLEASE REMEMBER: ANY DRONE OPERATOR MUST BE LICENSED BY THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY -- IF NOT, THEN IT IS ILLEGAL AND THEY WON'T BE INSURED.**
