**Sussex Aerial Property Drone Photography in Brighton, Hastings, Eastbourne, Haywards Heath, Lewes, Hailsham, Bexhill and surrounding towns and villages.**

Sometimes, images of a property from the ground just don't do enough, so we go that extra step further.

Some estate agents have used 'pole cam' shots in their publicity when promoting a property in the media, but we do so much more and allow you to show a home off to its full potential.

Using our UAV (or 'Home Drone' as we like to call it), we can photograph an array of different angles from anything up to 400ft, showing the real shape and boundaries of the property.

We have even worked with property owners themselves as some just aren't happy with the images taken by estate agents, so we stepped in to give them some stunning aerial shots.

Sussex Air Imaging now makes the impossible possible. What was once just a dream shot is now achievable for the fraction of the cost of hiring a crane or helicopter.

We are delighted to be working with agents in Sussex such as**[Clifford Dann][0]**,**Strutt and Parker**, **Graves Jenkins, Foresters **and**Batcheller Monkhouse.**[Click here to see what our clients say about working with Sussex Air Imaging.][1]

You can have your HD images the same day ready for use on your website or to send for use in magazines or newspapers.
