It is always a real pleasure to work with Paul of Sussex Air Imaging. He has the highest standards of professionalism and never fails to bring genuine passion and focus to his work. With so many drones now in the hands of inexperienced amateurs, it is essential to ensure that operators understand the law and the potential risks involved. With Sussex Air Imaging, you know you're always in safe hands -- literally!  
**Mike Carter, MCN Productions.**

Our requirements were simple, we needed 4K aerial visuals from a company that could fly a drone professionally and have the correct licences. Paul was able to deliver. Not only was the footage stable, clear and cinematic, but the whole service we received was 100%. Everyone should have aerial photography somewhere in their productions.  
**Matt Derbyshire, Smokescreen Visuals Ltd. **

We have worked with Paul of Sussex Air Imaging and have been amazed at his flying ability. The camera lens being used by Paul is 4K and delivers a brilliant quality finish which resulted in breathtaking footage.  A thoroughly professional drone and camera operator.  
**Colin, Brighton Video Production.**

We were very impressed with Sussex Air Imaging's expertise, and the images certainly do the house and grounds justice.  We'll certainly be using Sussex Air Imaging in the future. We required aerial  shots showing the surrounding countryside and far reaching views of one particular property and were recommended to use Sussex Air Imaging when drone photography seemed a good choice.  
**Toby Fordham, Foresters Estate Agents.**

We have worked with Sussex Air Imaging on a number of occasions and it has been a tremendous success. They are a professional and amenable, and have without doubt aided us in the sale of various properties whose marketing has been hugely enhanced by providing aerial images of the house and grounds. We will without doubt be using them regularly in the future.  
**Richard Bingham, Batcheller Monkhouse Estate Agents.**

Thank you so much for producing a fantastic video of our property within budget and on time. The video gives you a reel feel to the lay out of the property from the air that still pictures cannot show. We strongly recommend Sussex Air Imaging to anyone thinking of promoting or selling their property.  
**Johanna Hedberg, Angley Stud.**

Couldn't recommend Sussex Air Imaging enough -- their experienced pilot and camera operator really nailed our filming brief back in May and added that much needed dynamic to our project that traditional filming methods can't achieve -- all in 4K as well! Definitely bookmarked these guys for future projects!
